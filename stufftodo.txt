Card storage
You should not get in a situation where your hand is empty
conditional button rendering
Neat background lines
Make icons for buttons and make the appearance of buttons conditional

Authenticate cards?

Maybe make it so it only sends you a new hand at the start of the next turn if you have an empty hand to not ahve to use a time delay
Probably make that initial card lock cleaner
randomizedSelectionArray code could be condensed into one function

Winner declaration and new rounds, maybe add ticks to name plate for wins?

Joining in a second tab should redirect rather than just crashing the thing.
Make error redirects display more informative messages
Password protect games?
Space between cards in playerhand and playtable are different
If a game becomes fewer than 3 players it needs to not proceed
Isn't responsive on mozilla for some reason


Later priorities:
Make employer friendly version
Add database and like card learderboard
