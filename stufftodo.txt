Change score counter to update color as Card Czar
Probably make that initial card lock cleaner
Not entirely into the way the hand does or does not unlock yet. We'll see
When you select white cards to submit, I want a number to appear on them denoting order.
Does someone joining with a second tab fuck up the reconnecting? That's probably fixable.
Card storage
Make it do the right thing when someone else tries to make the same game.
Don't let Card Czar submit a red card to an empty lobby
Wasn't making a singular reconnected player into Czar
Make arrow button unselectable
I don't care for the cards being locked/unlocked in the playTable when the Czar is picking the winner
Card Czar can resubmit a blank card after card submit, fix that
Don't let game proceed with fewer than 3 players
When a player submitted a white card, the red card changed. My guess is that the currentCzar wasn't set to false for some reason.
Redrawn hand is unselectable
