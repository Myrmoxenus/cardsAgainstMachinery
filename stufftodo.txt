Don't let Card Czar submit a red card to an empty lobby
Wasn't making a singular reconnected player into Czar
Make arrow button unselectable
I don't care for the cards being locked/unlocked in the playTable when the Czar is picking the winner
Card Czar can resubmit a blank card after card submit, fix that
Don't let game proceed with fewer than 3 players
When a player submitted a white card, the red card changed. My guess is that the currentCzar wasn't set to false for some reason.
Redrawn hand is unselectable
Games need to decay
Winner declaration and new rounds, maybe add ticks to name plate for wins?
Vote to skip
Neat background lines
Make icons for buttons and make the appearance of buttons conditional
Card storage
Purchase cardsagainstmachinery.com // This was a mistake
Make previous name autofill the player name input when being modified
Make employer friendly version
Add database and like card learderboard
Authenticate cards?
Shuffling and card locking
Maybe make it so it only sends you a new hand at the start of the next turn if you have an empty hand to not ahve to use a time delay
Probably make that initial card lock cleaner
Joining in a second tab should redirect rather than just crashing the thing.
Make error redirects display more informative messages
